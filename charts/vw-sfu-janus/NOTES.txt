Token-gated signaling (Janus token_auth)

- Janus is configured with `token_auth=true` (see `janus.jcfg`).
- Janus checks the token before allowing Videoroom actions.

Recommended control-plane flow:

1) Operator requests a wall layout that includes WebRTC sources.
2) mgmt-api evaluates ABAC/RBAC policies (source access) and if allowed,
   mints a short-lived token for the specific Janus room/subscription.
3) Tile player uses the Janus REST/WS API and includes the token (e.g. in
   the `token` field of Janus messages, depending on client library).
4) Janus validates the token and only then grants room join / subscription.

Operational note:
- In air-gapped LAN mode (ice_lite=true), no STUN/TURN is required.
